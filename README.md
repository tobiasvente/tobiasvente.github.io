I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [ISG](https://isg.beel.org/) - Intelligent Systems Group (University of Siegen) in Siegen, Germany working on automation in recommender systems.
Generally, my research interests revolve around _machine learning_, specifically applying ideas from _AutoML_ (Automated Machine Learning) to _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.
