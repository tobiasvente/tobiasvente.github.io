I'm a joint Ph.D. candidate at the [ISG](https://isg.beel.org/) - Intelligent Systems Group (University of Siegen) in Siegen, Germany and the [ADReM](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/adrem-data-lab/) - Adrem Data Lab (University of Antwerp) in Antwerp, Belgium, working on model selection and automation in recommender systems.
Generally, my research interests revolve around _Recommender Systems_, specifically applying ideas from _AutoML_ (Automated Machine Learning) to _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.
